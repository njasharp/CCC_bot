Information about me:
My business: {business_name}
My offer: {business_description}
My target audience: {target_audience}
Dream outcome of my offer: {dream_outcome}
Perceived likelihood of achievement: {success_score}
Time delay to achieve outcome: {time_score}
Effort and sacrifice required: {effort_score}

You have to rate my offer based on Alex Hormozi's 4-part value equation framework:
How desirable is this offer's dream outcome on a scale of 1-10? This is called "Dream Score": {dream_score}.
How high is the offer's perceived likelihood of achievement on a scale of 1-100? This is called "Success Score": {success_score}.
How high is the offer's perceived time delay between purchasing the product and reaching the promised achievement on a scale from 1 to 100? This is called "Time Score": {time_score}.
How high is the offer's perceived effort and sacrifice on a scale of 1 to 100? This is the "Effort Score": {effort_score}.

After rating each of the 4 points mentioned above, calculate an 'offer score'. Provide actionable advice on how I can improve my offer.

Your Task: Provide an analysis of this offer, detailing how it could be optimized based on the components below.
- Dream Outcome of the Offer: Rate the desirability on a scale of 1-10. This is your "Dream Score": {dream_score}.
- Likelihood of Achievement: Estimate on a scale from 1-100, your "Success Score": {success_score}.
- Time Delay: Assess on a scale from 1 to 100: {time_score}.
- Effort and Sacrifice: Evaluate on a scale from 1 to 100: {effort_score}.

Calculation of Offer Score:
Multiply the "Dream Score" by the "Success Score."
Multiply the "Time Score" by the "Effort Score."
Divide to derive the final "Offer Score."

Provide actionable advice on how to enhance each component of the offer to maximize the overall score.
